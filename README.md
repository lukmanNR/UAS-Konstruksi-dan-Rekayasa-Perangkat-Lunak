Sistem Informasi dan Manajemen Klinik Pondok
By:Lukman Nur Rahman

What's the Problem?
Santri health data is still recorded manually (in logbooks).
Information is slow to reach Parents and Teachers.
Parents at home are surely worried because they don't know the latest condition of their child who is sick at the pondok.
Difficult to search for a santri's medical history when needed.

Solution: PESANTREN Clinic Information System
Goals;
1. Monitoring data digitally.
2. Information becomes fast, easy, and transparent.
3. Parents & Teachers can access health data in real-time.
